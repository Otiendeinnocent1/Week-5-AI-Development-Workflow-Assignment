1. Problem Definition 
Hypothetical Problem: Predicting student dropout rates in universities using academic and behavioral data.

Objectives:

Identify students at high risk of dropping out early.

Provide actionable insights for intervention programs.

Improve overall student retention rates.

Stakeholders:

University administrators (decision-makers).

Students (directly impacted by predictions and interventions).

KPI (Key Performance Indicator):
Retention rate improvement (%) across semesters.

2. Data Collection & Preprocessing 

Data Sources:

Academic records (grades, attendance, course load).

Learning management system logs (assignment submissions, login frequency).

Potential Bias:
Students with limited internet access (e.g., rural/low-income) may be underrepresented in LMS activity data → risk of unfairly labeling them as “at-risk.”

Preprocessing Steps:

Handle missing data (e.g., imputation for incomplete records).

Normalize features (grades, log counts) to a common scale.

Encode categorical variables (e.g., major, gender) using one-hot encoding.

3. Model Development 

Chosen Model: Random Forest

Justification: Robust to overfitting, interpretable feature importance, and handles mixed data types well.

Data Split:

70% training, 15% validation, 15% test.

Ensures enough training data while leaving unseen data for unbiased testing.

Hyperparameters to Tune:

Number of trees (n_estimators): Higher trees → better accuracy but slower training.

Maximum depth (max_depth): Prevents overfitting by limiting tree complexity.

4. Evaluation & Deployment 

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.

F1-Score: Balances precision and recall, critical for identifying true at-risk students without too many false alarms.

Concept Drift:

Definition: When the statistical properties of data change over time (e.g., new teaching methods, pandemic effects).

Monitoring: Periodic retraining and drift detection tests on live student data.

Technical Challenge (Deployment):

Scalability: Real-time predictions across thousands of students may require distributed systems or cloud deployment.
